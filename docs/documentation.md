# Coastr



This application shows hotels in Bratislava on a map. Most important features are:
- search by proximity to my current location
- search by hotel name
- intelligent ordering - by proximity and by hotel features
- hotels on the map are color coded by their quality assigned in stars (standard)

This is it in action:

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The application has 2 separate parts, the client which is a [frontend web application](#frontend) using mapbox API and mapbox.js and the [backend application](#backend) written in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), backed by PostGIS. The frontend application communicates with backend using a [REST API](#api) using GeoJSON.

# Frontend

The frontend application is a static HTML page (`index.html`), which shows a mapbox.js widget. It is displaying hotels, which are mostly in cities, thus the map style is based on the Emerald style. I modified the style to better highlight main sightseeing points, restaurants and bus stops, since they are all important when selecting a hotel. I also highlighted rails tracks to assist in finding a quiet location.

All relevant frontend code is in `application.js` which is referenced from `index.html`. The frontend code is very simple, its only responsibilities are:
- detecting user's location, using the standard [web location API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
- displaying the sidebar panel with hotel list and filtering controls, driving the user interaction and calling the appropriate backend APIs
- displaying geo features by overlaying the map with a geojson layer, the geojson is provided directly by backend APIs

# Backend

The backend application is written in Ruby on Rails and is responsible for querying geo data, formatting the geojson and data for the sidebar panel.

## Data

Hotel data is coming directly from Open Street Maps. I downloaded an extent covering whole Slovakia (around 1.2GB) and imported it using the `osm2pgsql` tool into the standard OSM schema in WGS 84 with hstore enabled. To speedup the queries I created an index on geometry column (`way`) in all tables. The application follows standard Rails conventions and all queries are placed in models inside `app/models`, mostly in `app/models/hotel.rb`. GeoJSON is generated by using a standard `st_asgeojson` function, however some postprocessing is necessary (in `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`) in order to merge all hotels into a single geojson.

## Api

**Find hotels in proximity to coordinates**

`GET /search?lat=25346&long=46346123`

**Find hotels by name, sorted by proximity and quality**

`GET /search?name=hviezda&lat=25346&long=46346123`

### Response

API calls return json responses with 2 top-level keys, `hotels` and `geojson`. `hotels` contains an array of hotel data for the sidebar, one entry per matched hotel. Hotel attributes are (mostly self-evident):
```
{
  "name": "Modra hviezda",
  "style": "modern", # cuisine style
  "stars": 3,
  "address": "Panska 31"
  "image_url": "/assets/hotels/652.png"
}
```
`geojson` contains a geojson with locations of all matched hotels and style definitions.

# Query examples

Create views from beaches

```sql
with beaches as (
    select name, osm_id, tags,
           ST_X(st_astext(way)) as longitude,
           ST_Y(st_astext(way)) as latitude
    from planet_osm_point
    where "natural" = 'beach'
    union all
    select name, osm_id, tags,
           st_x(st_astext(st_centroid(way)))
               as longitude,
           st_y(st_astext(st_centroid(way)))
               as latitude
    from planet_osm_polygon
    where "natural" = 'beach'
)

select name, osm_id, tags,
       st_polygon(st_makeline(ARRAY [
           st_point(longitude, latitude),
           st_point(longitude - 0.057635373, latitude - 0.02385071216053),
           st_point(longitude - 0.057635373, latitude + 0.02385071216053),
           st_point(longitude, latitude)
           ]), 3857) as way
```

Find intersection of views and coastline
```sql

```

# Data manipulation

I have created new table with gist index on way to store coastline information as:

```sql
create table spatial_coast (
    id integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    osm_id bigint,
    type varchar(15),
    tags hstore,
    way geometry(Geometry, 3857)
);

insert into spatial_coast (name, osm_id, type, tags, way)  (
    with coastline as (
        SELECT 'line' as type, *
        from planet_osm_line
        where "natural" = 'coastline'
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 'polygon' as type, *
        from planet_osm_polygon
        where "natural" = 'coastline'
    )
    select name, osm_id, type, tags, way
    from coastline
);

create index way_coast_index on spatial_coast using GIST(way);
```

I created table for sights from beach as well

```sql
create table beach_view (
    id integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    osm_id bigint,
    tags hstore,
    way geometry(Geometry, 3857)
);

insert into beach_view (name, osm_id, tags, way)  (
with beaches as (
    select name, osm_id, tags,
           ST_X(st_astext(way)) as longitude,
           ST_Y(st_astext(way)) as latitude
    from planet_osm_point
    where "natural" = 'beach'
    union all
    select name, osm_id, tags,
           st_x(st_astext(st_centroid(way)))
               as longitude,
           st_y(st_astext(st_centroid(way)))
               as latitude
    from planet_osm_polygon
    where "natural" = 'beach'
)

select name, osm_id, tags,
       st_polygon(st_makeline(ARRAY [
           st_point(longitude, latitude),
           st_point(longitude - 0.057635373, latitude - 0.02385071216053),
           st_point(longitude - 0.057635373, latitude + 0.02385071216053),
           st_point(longitude, latitude)
           ]), 3857) as way
from beaches
);

create index way_beach_index on spatial_coast using GIST(way);
```
